### RESEARCH
***Features and Benefits of the Tic-Tac-Toe Game It's often used as a pedagogical tool to teach ideas like good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with game tree searching. On this space, developing a computer algorithm to play faultless tic-tac-toe or enumerating the 765 basically different positions (state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (game tree complexity) is simple. Tic-tac-toe is a pointless game since it always ends in a draw if both players play optimally.***
